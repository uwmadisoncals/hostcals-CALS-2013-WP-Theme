This is a starting boilerplate setup for creating a Wordpress theme.

To get started, install node (if you dont already have it) and run 'npm install' from the boilerplate directory.

Once that is done, just run 'gulp watch'.



To review how preprocessing is handled, review Gulpfile.js located in the root of the repo.


Happy Coding!
